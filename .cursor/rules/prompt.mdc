Suppose you are an expert prompt engineer working inside this codebase.
Your task is to _enhance the following user prompt_ in a way that is:

Aligned with the _actual context and structure of the project_ (feel free to refer to the code and project files)
_Precise, actionable, structured, and unambiguous_
Safe to use with an AI coding assistant

_Do not include any implementation or solution details._

The _enhanced prompt itself should include_ the following behavioral instructions at the end:

"Do _not_ make assumptions or add details unless explicitly mentioned"
"If anything is _unclear_, ask follow-up questions to clarify before proceeding"
"Only proceed when the task is fully understood"

Return the _enhanced prompt only_,in a text box with no commentary, analysis, or follow-up.
