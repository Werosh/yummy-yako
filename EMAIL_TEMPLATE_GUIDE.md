# EmailJS Template Guide for Yummy Yako Forms

## Overview

This guide explains how the universal EmailJS template works with all three forms on the Yummy Yako website:

1. **Events Form** (`event_booking`) - Event booking inquiries
2. **Contact Form** (`contact_order`) - Order requests and general inquiries
3. **Career Form** (`career_application`) - Job applications with file metadata

## Template Compatibility

The email template is designed to work seamlessly with all three forms using dynamic content based on the `{{form_type}}` variable.

### Form Type Identification

Each form sends a different `form_type` value:

- Events Form: `event_booking`
- Contact Form: `contact_order`
- Career Form: `career_application`

## Email Template Features

### 1. Dynamic Header

The email header automatically shows the form type and subject:

```html
<h1>üç∞ Yummy Yako</h1>
<p>New {{form_type}} Submission</p>
<p>{{subject}}</p>
```

### 2. Formatted Content

All form data is presented in a clean, readable format using the `{{message}}` variable, which contains:

- Form-specific details
- Contact information
- Proper formatting with bullet points

### 3. File Information (Career Form Only)

For career applications, the template includes a special section with file metadata:

```html
{{#if resume_file}} üìé Resume File Information File Name: {{resume_file}} File
Size: {{resume_file_size}} File Type: {{resume_file_type}} {{/if}}
```

### 4. Contact Actions

Every email includes quick action buttons:

- üìß Reply to Customer (pre-filled subject)
- üìû Call Customer (direct phone link)

## File Upload Handling

### Important Note About File Attachments

EmailJS has limitations with file attachments, especially on the free plan. The current implementation:

‚úÖ **What Works:**

- File metadata (name, size, type) is included in the email
- Form submission works reliably
- All form data is captured and sent

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations:**

- Actual file attachments may not be delivered via EmailJS
- File size limits apply (typically 10MB)

### Recommended Solutions for Resume Files:

1. **Current Approach (Recommended):**

   - Collect file metadata in the email
   - Include instructions for applicants to email resumes separately
   - Add note in career form: "We'll contact you to request your resume"

2. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - Use a file upload service (Google Drive, Dropbox)
   - Implement a separate file upload endpoint
   - Use EmailJS paid plans with attachment support

## Template Setup Instructions

### 1. Copy Template Content

Use either:

- `emailjs-template-sample.html` (HTML format with styling)
- `emailjs-template-simple.txt` (Plain text format)

### 2. EmailJS Template Configuration

1. Go to your EmailJS dashboard
2. Navigate to Email Templates
3. Edit your template (ID: `template_9pzkrq7`)
4. Paste the template content
5. Save the template

### 3. Test All Forms

Test each form to ensure:

- ‚úÖ Events form sends event booking details
- ‚úÖ Contact form sends order information
- ‚úÖ Career form sends application with file metadata

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Template variables not displaying:**

   - Ensure variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - Check that the template is saved in EmailJS

2. **File information not showing:**

   - Verify the `{{#if resume_file}}` conditional is working
   - Check that file data is being passed correctly

3. **Form-specific data missing:**
   - Verify the `form_type` is being set correctly
   - Check the `createEmailParams` function in `src/config/emailjs.js`

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Contact form sends with order information
