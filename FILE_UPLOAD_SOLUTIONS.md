# File Upload Solutions for Career Form

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What's Working:

- File selection and validation
- File metadata capture (name, size, type)
- File information included in email
- Professional user experience

### ⚠️ Limitations:

- EmailJS free plan has limited file attachment support
- Actual file not sent via email
- File size restrictions

## Solutions for File Submissions

### Option 1: Current Approach (Recommended for Most Cases)

**How it works:**

1. User selects resume file
2. File metadata is captured and sent via email
3. Business contacts applicant to request actual file
4. Applicant sends file via email or file sharing service

**Pros:**

- Works reliably with EmailJS
- No additional setup required
- Professional workflow
- File validation works

**Cons:**

- Requires manual follow-up
- File not immediately available

### Option 2: File Sharing Integration

**Implementation:**

```javascript
// Add to career form
const uploadToCloudStorage = async (file) => {
  // Upload to Google Drive, Dropbox, or similar
  // Return shareable link
  // Include link in email
};
```

**Pros:**

- File immediately available
- Professional solution
- Works with any email service

**Cons:**

- Requires cloud storage setup
- Additional API integrations needed

### Option 3: EmailJS with File Attachments (Paid Plans)

**Requirements:**

- EmailJS paid plan
- File size limits apply
- May require additional configuration

**Implementation:**

```javascript
// Enhanced file handling for paid EmailJS plans
const sendWithAttachment = async (templateParams, file) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append("attachment", file);
  // Add other parameters...

  return emailjs.sendForm(SERVICE_ID, TEMPLATE_ID, formData, PUBLIC_KEY);
};
```

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach (Best User Experience)

**Implementation:**

1. Collect file metadata via form
2. Provide multiple file submission options:
   - Email the file separately
   - Upload to file sharing service
   - Use a dedicated file upload endpoint

**User Instructions:**
